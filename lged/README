This is basically a command-line version of lgeneral-redit.
It can also be used to query any units within the pg-unit-library.

Most source files are shared with lgeneral-redit and can be found there.

lged can be run from within the source directory or the installation directory,
depending on the location of the executable.

Note that you cannot perform any changes if the resources are not writeable.
You can still read any properties.
