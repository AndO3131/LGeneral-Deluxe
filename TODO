Recent:
- implement LEVELBOMBER flag for strategic bombing (is BOMBER right now)
- have a proper engine status strategic bombing for animation and results
- give prestige and experience for strategic bombing

**** Gameplay

- ingame help screen with all shortcuts and interface explanation
- allow destruction of airfields/towns by level bombers
  or give suppression on the supply rate
- France with 25/30 turns instead of 13/26 ???
- when is the west beaten ???
- 100% supply to hexes and 20% min ???
- reinforcements
- campaign: support debriefing depending on scenario outcome
- allow adjacent initial deploy hexes only within the convex hull
  of allied units to prevent moving the whole front line one step
  forward

**** Display

- unit list window (with picture) to select a unit (goto unit)
- message when reinforcements have arrived
- victory hexes are bad to see many units are arround
- scenario briefings for the campaign
- edit sometimes broken? (string too long, many blanks)
- add a video mode of 800x480 for Nokia devices

**** AI 

- whether enemy may attack a truck position must be checked not only
  by getting the plain distance but by computing the required path 
  to allow placement behind a closed front line
- aricrafts out of action do not return to game

- during AI move view is not toggled (can't see airplan damage)
- check bug: paratroops do not attack in crete and south france
- airplanes do not return though out of fuel and in reach
  of an airfield (warsaw)
- trucks cannot pass rivers in bad weather and they don't try to take
  the longer way around
- in Barbarossa scenario I tried to kill
  enemy artillery - I didn't make it, it was left with 2 poits of
  strength. Next round I attacked it with my tank, something
  strange happened - enemy Art dissapeared, then it showed with str
  15, and then my own tank was considered as enemy for my other
  troops (it stopped movement, and its strength increased to 15) -
  I think that somehow enemy artillery has swapped with him (but
  graphics remained the same) - like in SF movies ;)
  Could not reproduce this bug later.
- AI must protect own cities with units
- AI groups: implement execution order (artillery fire, bombers, 
  fighters, ground units, artillery movement)
- loop execution several times to move when a unit which is 
  handled later blocked the destination position
- tweak tactical action scores (are quite good already though)
- AI does not protect airborne units
- AI does not go for U-boots
